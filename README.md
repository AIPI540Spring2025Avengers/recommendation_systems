# Hotel Recommendation System

## Overview

Travelers often struggle to find the ideal hotel that matches their unique preferences and constraints. Whether searching for luxury accommodations, budget-friendly options, or hotels offering specific amenities, existing platforms rarely deliver personalized recommendations. This project develops a robust recommendation system tailored to individual traveler interests and needs.


## Data Processing Pipeline

---

### Data Download and Loading
- Downloads the hotels dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raj713335/tbo-hotels-dataset/data)
- Loads the raw data into memory for processing

---

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Cleans column names by removing whitespace and standardizing formatting
- Removes duplicate hotel entries
- Renames columns for consistency (e.g., `countyName` â†’ `country`)
- Converts star ratings from text (e.g., `"Three Star"`) to numeric values
- Removes invalid or non-numeric ratings (e.g., `"All"`)
- Drops irrelevant columns such as fax numbers and phone numbers
- Extracts latitude and longitude from map coordinate strings

---

### Amenity Extraction
- Parses hotel facilities text to identify standardized amenities
- Uses fuzzy matching against a predefined amenity vocabulary
- Creates a clean list of amenities for each hotel entry

---

### ðŸ’¾ Data Storage
- Stores raw data in: `data/raw/hotels.csv`
- Stores cleaned and processed data in: `data/processed/hotels_cleaned.csv`


## Modeling Approaches 

### NaÃ¯ve Rule-Based Classifier
- Top 10 hotel recommendation based on rating for specific locations

### Traditional Machine Learning
- A hybrid filtering method combines multiple techniques to capture user preferences and rank hotel recommendations effectively.

- **Matrix Factorization:**  
  Utilize techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS).

- **Gradient Boosting:**  
  Implement ranking models using XGBoost and LightGBM.

### Deep Learning 
WIP
- For capturing complex patterns in both numeric and textual data, the deep learning approach integrates neural networks with transformer-based models. 


**Evaluation Metrics:**  
We use NDCG@K to evaluate all modeling approaches, as each produces a ranked list of hotel recommendations. NDCG rewards models that place highly relevant hotels at the top of the list, making it ideal for this task. It also accounts for the position of each recommendation, ensuring that correctly ranked top hotels contribute more to the score than those ranked lower. 

## User Interface

- **Streamlit Web App**: 
WIP

## Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script takes care of setting up your virtual environment if it does not already exist, activating it, installing requirements, pulling the dataset (if not already present in the data directory), pre-processing the data for the traditional model (feature extraction), and traditional model training.

## Running the Streamlit application locally

Assuming your virtual environment is setup and activated, and that the requirements are installed from running `setup.sh`,
you can then run the following to startup a local instance of the Streamlit application.

```bash
python main.py
```
